The project realizes several solutions to the problem of finding a minimal spanning tree, 
to explore and analyze the differences between the various solutions.
The minimum spanning trees are calculated by two main algorithms:
	1. Kruskal algorithm when the sorting is realized by sort-quick algorithm and groups
	    Wreaths are realized with the help of trees.
	2. Prim algorithm when the priority queue is implemented by a binary stack.
	3. Next, the user will enter one arc that must be removed from the graph, and if the arc
	   Belongs to a minimal spanning tree that you found with the help of Kruskal, 
	   a new minimal spanning tree must be found that does not contain it.
